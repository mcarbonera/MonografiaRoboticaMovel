\begin{abstract}

The present work aimed to explore the use of behavior-based architecture in the 
field of mobile robotics. In this sense, the two existing strategies found in the literature
were used: behavior arbitration and fusion. The first was implemented using
hybrid control (discrete event systems with continuous variables controllers),
while the second used \textit{Fuzzy} controllers for its execution.
