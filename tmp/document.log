Package pgfplots Warning: the content of your 3d axis has changed compared to p
revious versions of pgfplots. please review it. 
 [continued] explanation: you have a 3d axis with 'axis equal' and/or 'unit vec
tor ratio' which has (probably) been optimized for an older version of pgfplots
. any version older than 1.6 produced wrong output.
 [continued] to remove this warning, write \pgfplotsset{compat=1.6} (or newer) 
in your preamble (may change all figures in your document) or by adding that to
 the affected axis. on input line 44.

Package pgfplots Warning: Axis range for axis z is approximately empty; enlargi
ng it (it is [0.0:0.0]) on input line 44.

Package pgfplots Warning: the content of your 3d axis has changed compared to p
revious versions of pgfplots. please review it. 
 [continued] explanation: you have a 3d axis with 'axis equal' and/or 'unit vec
tor ratio' which has (probably) been optimized for an older version of pgfplots
. any version older than 1.6 produced wrong output.
 [continued] to remove this warning, write \pgfplotsset{compat=1.6} (or newer) 
in your preamble (may change all figures in your document) or by adding that to
 the affected axis. on input line 73.

 [warning /pgfplots/warning/axis equal incompatible change]

Package pgfplots Warning: Axis range for axis z is approximately empty; enlargi
ng it (it is [0.0:0.0]) on input line 73.
